/**
 * A program fragment for which an abstract transformer can be computed.
 *
 * Location graph
 * ==============
 * Control Flow Graphs typically found in static program analysis have effects
 * associated either with nodes or edges. SSA form used in LLVM makes things
 * slightly more complicated: The computation happens mostly in nodes (basic
 * blocks) but phi instructions are evaluated according to the incoming edge.
 *
 * To define fragments, we will conceptually operate on a CFG with computation
 * happening on edges. This CFG is defined as:
 *  1. The set of locations is equal to the set of basic blocks of the LLVM IR
 *     *plus an additional location* Fragment::EXIT.
 *  2. The set of edges is equal to all the edges in the original basic block
 *     *plus an additional edge* to Fragment::EXIT from every location
 *     corresponding to a basic block with no successors.
 *
 * Therefore, Fragment::EXIT is the only location with no outgoing edges.
 *
 * By a *state at a location* we will mean the program state after executing
 * all the phi instructions in the basic block but before executing any non-phi
 * instruction. Fragment::EXIT behaves like an empty block.
 *
 * Thus, the computational effect of an edge between A and B corresponds to
 * evaluating all non-phi instructions in A and all phis in B.
 *
 * Example
 * -------
 * If a program's IR has only one basic block called S, we will consider this
 * program to have two locations: S and Fragment::EXIT. There is only one edge
 * and it's between S and Fragment::EXIT. The effect of this edge corresponds
 * to executing all the instructions in the basic block S (note that in LLVM
 * the entry block cannot contain any phis).
 *
 * What is a fragment?
 * ===================
 * Fragment is a acyclic subgraph of the location graph defined above, uniquely
 * determined by a nonempty set of edges E.
 *
 * A location that has outgoing edges in the set E but no incoming edges in E
 * will be called a *starting location*. Similarly, a location with incoming
 * edges in E but no outgoing edges will be called an *ending location*. You
 * can check whether a location belongs to one of these classes by calling
 * isStart() or isEnd().
 *
 * Each fragment can be thought to represent a set of computations that start
 * in some state in one of the starting locations and end in one of the ending
 * locations. As a special case, the fragment might include non-phi
 * instructions of its ending location. Use includesEndBody() to check whether
 * this is the case.
 *
