/**
 * @file Dominator.h
 * @brief Dominator and Post-Dominator Analysis
 *
 * This file provides classes for computing dominator and post-dominator trees
 * of LLVM IR functions. Dominators are fundamental data-flow analysis results
 * used in compiler optimizations, static analysis, and program verification.
 *
 * Dominators:
 * - A node A dominates node B if every path from the entry to B must go through
 * A
 * - The immediate dominator of B is the unique closest dominator of B
 * (excluding B)
 * - The dominator tree organizes these relationships hierarchically
 *
 * Post-Dominators:
 * - A node A post-dominates node B if every path from B to the exit must go
 * through A
 * - Computed similarly to dominators but on the reversed CFG

 * queries.
 *
 * Dominator trees enable efficient queries about:
 * - Whether one instruction/basic block dominates another
 * - The nearest common dominator of two nodes
 * - The dominance frontier
 * - Variable liveness analysis
 *
 * @note DominatorSummary is typically constructed by Dominator or PostDominator
 * passes
 * @see DominatorForest for the underlying tree data structure
