/**
 * @brief Performs a single step of the Constraint Walk algorithm.
 *
 * The Constraint Walk is a heuristic random walk where the search direction is chosen
 * based on the normal vectors of the polytope's constraints.
 *
 * The step involves:
 * 1. Randomly selecting one of the linear constraints defining the polytope.
 * 2. Using the normal vector of the selected constraint (its coefficients) as the search direction.
 * 3. Computing the line segment (chord) along this direction within the polytope.
 * 4. Sampling a new point uniformly from this segment.
 *
 * This strategy can be useful for exploring "corners" or boundaries of the polytope defined
 * by specific constraints.
 *
 * @param constraints The set of linear constraints (Ax <= b) defining the polytope.
 * @param point [in,out] The current point in the walk. Must be a feasible point inside the polytope.
 *                       On success, this is updated to the new sample point.
 * @param rng The random number generator (64-bit Mersenne Twister).
 * @return true if the step was successful, false otherwise.
