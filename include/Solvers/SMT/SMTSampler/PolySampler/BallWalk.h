/**
 * @brief Performs a single step of the Ball Walk algorithm.
 *
 * The Ball Walk is a simple MCMC algorithm where the next point is chosen uniformly
 * from a ball of fixed radius centered at the current point.
 *
 * The algorithm proceeds as follows:
 * 1. Generate a candidate point uniformly from a small box (L-infinity ball) or ball around the current point.
 *    In this implementation, it perturbs each coordinate by a small random integer offset.
 * 2. Check if the candidate point satisfies all linear constraints (is inside the polytope).
 * 3. If valid, move to the candidate point (accept); otherwise, stay at the current point (reject).
 *    Note: The implementation here returns `false` on rejection/failure to find a valid point after retries,
 *    effectively staying at the same point from the caller's perspective (or retrying).
 *
 * @param constraints The set of linear constraints (Ax <= b) defining the polytope.
 * @param point [in,out] The current point in the walk. Must be a feasible point inside the polytope.
 *                       On success, this is updated to the new sample point.
 * @param rng The random number generator (64-bit Mersenne Twister).
 * @return true if the step resulted in a move to a new valid point, false otherwise.
