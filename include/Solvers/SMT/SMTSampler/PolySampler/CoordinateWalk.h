/**
 * @brief Performs a single step of the Coordinate Hit-and-Run algorithm.
 *
 * This variant of the Hit-and-Run algorithm restricts the search direction to be
 * aligned with one of the coordinate axes.
 *
 * The step involves:
 * 1. Randomly selecting one of the coordinate axes (dimensions).
 * 2. Defining a line passing through the current point parallel to the selected axis.
 * 3. Computing the intersection of this line with the polytope boundaries.
 * 4. Sampling a new point uniformly from the valid segment along this axis.
 *
 * This method is computationally cheaper per step than general Hit-and-Run since
 * it only modifies one coordinate at a time, but it may mix more slowly if the
 * polytope is not axis-aligned.
 *
 * @param constraints The set of linear constraints (Ax <= b) defining the polytope.
 * @param point [in,out] The current point in the walk. Must be a feasible point inside the polytope.
 *                       On success, this is updated to the new sample point.
 * @param rng The random number generator (64-bit Mersenne Twister).
 * @return true if the step was successful (a valid next point was found), false otherwise.
