/**
 * @brief Performs a single step of the Dikin Walk algorithm.
 *
 * The Dikin Walk is a random walk based on the Dikin ellipsoid, which adapts to the
 * local geometry of the polytope. It is generally more efficient than the Ball Walk
 * or Coordinate Walk for ill-conditioned polytopes (long and thin shapes).
 *
 * This implementation uses a diagonal approximation of the Hessian of the logarithmic barrier function
 * to define the local metric (ellipsoid).
 *
 * The step involves:
 * 1. Computing the diagonal elements of the Hessian at the current point.
 * 2. Generating a random direction scaled by the inverse square root of these diagonal elements
 *    (effectively sampling from the local ellipsoid).
 * 3. Finding the intersection of the line along this direction with the polytope boundaries.
 * 4. Sampling a new point along the valid segment.
 *
 * @param constraints The set of linear constraints (Ax <= b) defining the polytope.
 * @param point [in,out] The current point in the walk. Must be a feasible point inside the polytope.
 *                       On success, this is updated to the new sample point.
 * @param rng The random number generator (64-bit Mersenne Twister).
 * @return true if the step was successful, false otherwise.
