/**
 * \class UnrollVectorsPass
 * \brief Vector unrolling pass for converting vector operations to scalar
 * operations
 *
 * This pass expands vector-typed operations into scalar operations, which can
 * be useful for:
 * - Targets that don't support vector instructions
 * - Analysis tools that only handle scalar operations
 * - Further optimization of vector operations by scalar passes
 *
 * The pass handles:
 * - Vector load instructions (expanding into scalar loads)
 * - Vector store instructions (expanding into scalar stores)
 * - Vector PHI nodes (expanding into scalar PHI nodes)
 * - InsertElement instructions (expanding into scalar assignments)
 * - ExtractElement instructions (expanding into scalar loads)
 *
 * Note: The pass does not delete vector operations on its own, but leaves them
 * unused so that dead code elimination can remove them.
