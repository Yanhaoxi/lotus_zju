/**
 * \class SoftFloatPass
 * \brief Soft-float transformation pass for software floating-point emulation
 *
 * This pass replaces all floating-point instructions with calls to the
 * corresponding libgcc softfloat library functions. This is essential for
 * targets that lack native floating-point hardware support.
 *
 * The pass handles:
 * - Floating-point arithmetic operations (fadd, fsub, fmul, fdiv, fneg)
 * - Floating-point conversions (fptosi, fptoui, sitofp, uitofp, fpext, fptrunc)
 * - Floating-point comparisons (fcmp)
 *
 * After this pass, the IR contains no floating-point operations, making it
 * suitable for soft-float targets.
