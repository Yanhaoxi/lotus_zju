# Newtonian Program Analysis

We use the engine in include/Dataflow/NPA/NPA.h.

A generic method for solving *interprocedural dataflow equations* by *generalizing Newton’s method** to **ω-continuous semirings*.

The key insight is that Newton’s method can be reformulated **purely algebraically**, without subtraction, division, or limits, and applied to semirings.  
This yields faster convergence while preserving correctness and robustness.

Analyses are expressed over an **ω-continuous semiring**: $⟨S, +, ·, 0, 1⟩$

- `+`: join / aggregation (may be non-idempotent)
- `·`: sequencing / composition
- supports infinite sums and a natural order `⊑`

This generalizes:
- lattices (classical dataflow analysis),
- language semirings,
- counting semirings,
- probabilistic and cost semirings.
