# IFDS/IDE Dataflow Analysis

## Writing An Analysis

*Use IFDS**, if
- your analysis is a plain reachability problem, that is, a data-flow fact can either hold, or not.
- your analysis problem is distributive, that is, within a flow function the reachability of a successor fact may depend on at most one incoming fact.
- your analysis problem is a may-analysis, since IFDS always uses set-union as merge operator

All bit-vector problems fall into this category, including all classical gen-kill problems. Examples are taint analysis, uninitialized-variables analysis, constness analysis, etc.


*Use IDE**, if

- your analysis computes environments that associate the holding data-flow facts with an additional computed value
- OR the set of holding data-flow facts is structured, i.e. some facts subsume other facts
- OR your analysis is a must-analysis, since in contrast to IFDS the merge operator is customizable
- your analysis problem is distributive, that is, within a flow function the reachability a of a successor fact as well as its associated value may depend on at most one incoming fact/value.

Examples are linear constant-propagation, typestate analysis, type analysis, feature-taint analysis, etc.
