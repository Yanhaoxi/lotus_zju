 * @brief Implementation of Zone abstraction (Difference Bound Matrices - DBM)
 * 
 * This module implements zone abstraction (also known as Difference Bound Matrices)
 * for computing the least zone describing a set of bit-vectors V subject to formula φ.
 * 
 * **Zone Domain:**
 * The zone domain is a relational numerical abstract domain that tracks difference
 * constraints of the form x - y ≤ c and unary constraints of the form x ≤ c.
 * Zones are represented using Difference Bound Matrices (DBM), which efficiently
 * store and manipulate these constraints.
 * 
 * **Constraint Forms:**
 * - **Unary constraints**: ⟨v_i⟩ ≤ d  (upper bounds on individual variables)
 * - **Binary constraints**: ⟨v_i⟩ - ⟨v_j⟩ ≤ d  (difference bounds between pairs)
 * 
 * **Comparison with Octagon Domain:**
 * - Zones are **more restrictive** than octagons (octagons allow ±x ± y ≤ c)
 * - Zones are **computationally more efficient** (O(n²) vs O(n²) but with simpler
 *   constraint structure and faster closure operations)
 * - Zones are **sufficient** for many applications, particularly:
 *   * Timing analysis in real-time systems
 *   * Scheduling problems
 *   * Verification of systems with deadline constraints
 * 
 * **Mathematical Properties:**
 * Zones form a lattice with meet (conjunction), join (disjunction), and closure
 * (transitive closure of difference constraints) operations. The closure operation
 * (using Floyd-Warshall algorithm) ensures consistency and canonical form.
 * 
 * **Algorithm Overview:**
 * The algorithm computes bounds for all unary and binary constraints:
 * 1. For each variable v_i, compute upper bound using α_lin-exp with expression v_i
 * 2. For each pair (v_i, v_j), compute bound for difference v_i - v_j using α_lin-exp
 * 3. Collect all valid constraints into the result
 * 
 * **Use Cases:**
 * - Real-time system verification
 * - Timing analysis and deadline checking
 * - Scheduling constraint verification
 * - Any analysis where difference constraints are sufficient

/**
 * @brief Compute zone abstraction α_zone^V(φ)
 *
 * Computes the least zone (Difference Bound Matrix) describing the set of
 * bit-vectors V subject to formula φ. The algorithm systematically computes
 * bounds for all unary and binary difference constraints.
 *
 * **Algorithm Steps:**
 * 1. **Unary constraints**: For each variable v_i, compute the maximum value
 *    using α_lin-exp with expression v_i, giving upper bound v_i ≤ d
 *
 * 2. **Binary constraints**: For each pair (v_i, v_j) with i ≠ j, compute
 *    the maximum of v_i - v_j using α_lin-exp, giving difference bound
 *    v_i - v_j ≤ d
 *
 * 3. Collect all valid constraints (where bounds can be computed) into the result
 *
 * **Note on Lower Bounds:**
 * The current implementation computes upper bounds for unary constraints (v_i ≤ d).
 * Lower bounds can be obtained by computing -v_i ≤ d' and deriving v_i ≥ -d',
 * but in standard zone representation, lower bounds are typically expressed as
 * difference constraints relative to a special zero variable, or as unary constraints
 * using negation. The code includes a commented section for lower bounds that can
 * be extended if needed.
 *
 * **Example:**
 * For variables {x, y} and formula φ = (x ≥ 0) ∧ (x ≤ 10) ∧ (y ≥ x) ∧ (y ≤ 20),
 * the algorithm would produce constraints like:
 * - x ≤ 10, y ≤ 20 (unary upper bounds)
 * - y - x ≤ 0 (from y ≥ x, which gives y - x ≤ 0)
 * - x - y ≤ 10 (from the combined bounds)
 *
 * @param phi The formula constraining the variables (bit-vector SMT formula)
 * @param variables The set of bit-vector variables V = {v_1, ..., v_n}
 * @param config Configuration including timeout and iteration limits
 * @return Vector of zone constraints representing the least zone
 *
 * @note The algorithm has O(n²) complexity where n is the number of variables,
 *       as it considers all pairs of variables for difference constraints.
 * @note Constraints that cannot be bounded (α_lin-exp returns None) are skipped.
 * @note Reflexive constraints (v_i - v_i ≤ 0) are always true and are skipped.
