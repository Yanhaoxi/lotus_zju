Alias Analysis Components
==========================

Lotus provides several alias analysis algorithms with different precision/performance trade-offs. Each analysis makes different trade-offs between precision, scalability, and analysis cost.

Analysis Selection Guide
-------------------------

Choose the right analysis for your needs:

**For Large Codebases (Speed Priority)**:

- **SparrowAA (CI mode)**: Fastest, context-insensitive, inclusion-based
- **AserPTA (CI mode)**: Fast with field sensitivity option
- **AllocAA**: Lightweight heuristic-based tracking
- **FPA (KELP)**: Specialized for function pointer resolution
- **SRAA**: Range-based for proving non-aliasing
- **DyckAA**: Unification-based with Dyck-CFL reachability

**For Maximum Precision**:

- **LotusAA**: Flow-sensitive and field-sensitive
- **Sea-DSA**: Unification-based, context-sensitive with heap cloning
- **SparrowAA (1-CFA, 2-CFA)**: Context-sensitive, inclusion-based
- **AserPTA (1-CFA, 2-CFA, Origin)**: Context-sensitive, inclusion-based
