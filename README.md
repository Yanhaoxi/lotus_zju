# Lotus 

Lotus is a program analysis, verification, and optimization framework. It provides several toolkits that can be used individually or in combination to perform different tasks.
The current version has been tested on x86/ARM Linux and ARM Mac using LLVM-14 with Z3-4.11.

## Components

For a detailed list of subsystems (alias analyses, intermediate representations,
solvers, abstract interpreters, and utilities), see the
[Major Components Overview](https://zju-pl.github.io/lotus/major_components.html)
section of the documentation. The docs provide links to the relevant libraries,
command-line tools, and example usage for each component.

## Binary Tools

For detailed documentation on using the binary tools, see [tools](https://zju-pl.github.io/lotus/tools.html).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- LLVM 14.x
- Z3 4.11
- CMake 3.10+
- C++14 compatible compiler

### Build Lotus

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZJU-PL/lotus
cd lotus
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

**Notes**:

- The build system assumes that the system has a supported LLVM (14.x) and Z3 installed.
- If CMake cannot find LLVM automatically (for example, when using a custom or locally built LLVM),
  re-run CMake with:

  ```bash
  cmake .. -DLLVM_BUILD_PATH=/path/to/llvm/lib/cmake/llvm
  ```

The build system will automatically download and build Boost if it's not found on your system. You can specify a custom Boost installation path with `-DCUSTOM_BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost`.

> **TODO**: Implement automatic download of LLVM and Z3 dependencies
